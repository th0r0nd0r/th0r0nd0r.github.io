description: I used the HTML5 File API to handle file manipulation browser-side, then came up with some algorithms to break a file into words and filter out those that don't matter.

Finally I used D3 to make a force layout graph with the most-used words in a text.

- The radius of a word corresponds to the number of occurrences of that word in the text (relative to the other words)
- The color gradient is another visual representation of a word's concentration.
